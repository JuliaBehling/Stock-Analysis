# **Stock Market Analysis via Microsoft Excel VBA Code**

# 1. Overview of Project: 

### Explain the purpose of this analysis:

#### The purpose of the Module 2 Challenge was to create a Microsoft Excel VBA code capable of analyzing open-source market information of stocks at a year-by-year timeframe. The end result of this program allowed the user to infer the most promising companies to invest in. After the initial running of the program, the programmer consolidated the code and increased the efficiency and speed of the VBA program.

# 2. Results:
## Stock Performance Between the Years 2017 & 2018:

#### In 2017, the yearly return rate for the vast majority of analyzed stocks was >0%. Meaning individuals who invested in those stocks gained more net worth. However, in the year 2018, the return rate drastically decreased and most stocks lost value (<0%) (Figure 1 & 2).

## Improved Run-Time Efficiency with Refactored Code
#### The second portion of this analysis consisted of refactoring the VBA code to decrease repetition in script and increase running efficiency. After cleaning up the code, run-times for the scripts decreased from over 1 second with the original code (Figure 3 & 4) to an average of 0.25 seconds per run with refactored Scripts. (Figure 5 & 6).

# 3. Summary:
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code in General:

#### A major advantage of refactoring code is the heightened level of run-time efficiency. By increasing speed, the user is able to run larger and more complex datasets in a faster timeframe; leading the user to have greater analytical power. One disadvantage of refactoring code is the opportunity cost of physical time. If the code is only ever intended for simple or ocassional use, the opportunity cost of using personal time may outweigh the neccessity of refactoring in the first place. Deadlines and the need for project completetion are both important factors to consider when deciding on whether or not to refactor code.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original Refactored VBA Script:

#### One advantage for the refactored VBA script is increased running speed. Being able to run larger, more complex datasets makes this tool significantly more powerful. One disadvantage however is the time it took to figure out and shorten the code. This issue will be fixed in time as the coder improves on their skillset. One advantage of the original VBA script is it is easier for the beginner-programmer to read and comprehend. A disadvantage would be the slowed running time and the numerous running loops that take while to work.
